Hi I'm Anutam Srinivasan. I am a senior at Ohio State University studying Electrical & Computer Engineering and Mathematics. During my undergrad, I have been fortunate to work under the guidance of Dr. Aaron Nielsen to develop 
physics-informed machine learning approaches for magnetic anomaly navigation, Dr. Srini Parthasarathy and Dr. Pranav Maneriker to consider problems within fairness and uncertainty quantification, and Dr. Kannan Athreya to identify signal leakage within the powerline. 

In my Ph.D., I am interested in developing approaches to guarantee safety and robustness for robotic systems using techniques in uncertainty quantification and physics-informed machine learning.
