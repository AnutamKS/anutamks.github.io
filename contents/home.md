Hi I'm Anutam Srinivasan. I am a senior at Ohio State University (Go Buckeyes!), double majoring in Computer Engineering and Mathematics. I am broadly interested in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, with an emphasis on safety, fairness, and uncertainty quantification.

During my undergraduate program, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of Dr. Aaron Nielsen (Air Force Institute of Technology) to develop physics-informed machine-learning approaches for magnetic anomaly navigation in GPS-contested environments. I have explored fair conformal predictors for auditing and enhancing graph-based models with Dr. Pranav Maneriker (Dolby Laboratories) and Dr. Srinivasan Parthasarathy (OSU). Finally,  I am working with Dr. Kannan Athreya (OSU) to develop methods to identify and mitigate signal leakage on wireless communications from phones connected to the powerline.

I will pursue a PhD in Robotics at Georgia Tech and start in Fall 2025. I am excited to explore trustworthy and safe robotic systems with applications in human-robot interaction, multimodal manipulation, navigation, and autonomy. Go, Yellowjackets!
